## 1. Authority and exact scope

The Human Architect separately authorized repository implementation of Development Assignment 1,
Workstreams A–E, from the exact baseline above after accepting ADR-0012 and Authorization Sections
3–13. The implementation stays inside that release:

- repository contracts, dependencies, migration `010`, backend/API, Mobile/native and automated
  verification only;
- no production resource, production data, deployment or distribution;
- no Human Physical Gate execution or claim;
- the server remains the sole lifecycle authority;
- accepted numeric and authority policies are unchanged.

`research/` was not read, listed or modified during implementation.

## 2. Implemented repository boundary

### Shared contract and cryptography

- New decision-free `@taptime/offline-sync-contract` workspace with closed lease, event,
  reconciliation, local-state and UI-safe unions.
- Accepted numeric limits are centralized and immutable: 12-hour lease, five-minute anchor
  tolerance, 72-hour automatic window, 4,096 items/4 MiB activation, 256 events/1 MiB unresolved
  queue, 16-KiB request/response, 64-KiB lease-page response and 1–900-second retry bounds.
- Node and Mobile share exact canonical framing, validation and golden HMAC-SHA-256/manifest
  vectors. The raw NFC payload and lookup key do not enter lease persistence or result contracts.

### PostgreSQL and least privilege

- Additive migration `010_complete_offline_synchronization.sql`; migrations `001`–`009` and their
  ledger semantics remain intact.
- Organization-qualified, forced-RLS offline installation, lease, item, receipt, cursor and
  reconciliation tables.
- Three distinct executor roles and three distinct non-login function owners for lease,
  event-ingestion and reconciliation capabilities. Roles are normalized fail-closed on rerun and
  receive no sibling membership, DDL, arbitrary role selection or general table authority.
- Runtime functions are `PUBLIC`-revoked, fixed-search-path capabilities. The additional
  predecessor check prevents a later installation from bypassing unresolved review evidence for
  the same Organization/User.
- Exact event/sequence/receipt collision precedence, advisory locking, atomic cursor advance,
  immutable durable result identity and lost-response reconciliation are covered by PostgreSQL
  integration tests.
- Historical Assignment/Customer deactivation after physical capture remains valid only for the
  earlier captured interval. Missing historical configuration is non-durable
  `temporarily_unavailable`; it is never silently adjudicated.

### Backend and HTTP

- New `@taptime/backend-offline-sync` package owns authenticated lease issue/page, one-event FIFO
  ingestion and exact-ID reconciliation.
- Four exact routes were added:
  `POST /v1/offline-capture-leases`,
  `POST /v1/offline-capture-leases/page`,
  `POST /v1/lifecycle-events/offline` and
  `POST /v1/lifecycle-events/reconcile`.
- Runtime composition requires three username-distinct PostgreSQL URLs in addition to every
  existing pool. Duplicate usernames and request-selected role/authority hints fail closed.
- Strict exact-key parsing, canonical UUID/base64url/timestamp validation, body and response byte
  limits, ten-second deadline, bounded `Retry-After`, disclosure-safe diagnostics and closed result
  mapping are exercised through the real HTTP server.
- The CI remains ten jobs; the neutral offline contract is built/tested in Quality, the real
  PostgreSQL offline matrix runs in the API job, and the synthetic job builds every new dependency.

### Mobile and Android

- Separate SecureStore-held 256-bit installation binding, lookup key and SQLCipher key.
- One SQLCipher-backed database actor verifies cipher integrity/schema, owns exclusive
  transactions, assembles immutable lease generations, appends evidence before network work,
  enforces FIFO/size limits and quarantines ambiguous or corrupt state without deletion.
- E1/E2A legacy evidence is read back before clear and imported only under the accepted
  review-safe rules.
- Lease pagination rejects duplicate items/lookups, cross-owner/header drift, manifest mismatch,
  non-adjacent cursor cycles, more than 41 page responses and incomplete/oversize activation.
- One process-wide single-flight scheduler handles runtime/session/foreground/append/network/manual
  and background triggers. Network is only a hint; Expo background execution remains explicitly
  best effort.
- A local Expo native module supplies Android boot marker and
  `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` evidence. Expo SQLite is configured with SQLCipher and the
  background/network/task modules are tracked.
- Scan UI receives only immutable safe states such as locally saved, synchronizing, server review,
  server decision or protected. It receives no token, key, SQL, raw UID or client lifecycle
  decision capability.

## 3. Adversarial and failure evidence

The focused suites prove:

- exact lease idempotency, immutable pagination and projection digest;
- cross-Organization, cross-User, cross-installation and sibling-role rejection;
- later revocation/historical capture separation and 72-hour review transition;
- event, device-sequence and receipt collision fail-closed behavior with zero extra writes;
- sequence gaps, lock retry, lost response, exact reconciliation and same-result replay;
- unresolved review predecessor propagation across installations;
- transactional queue append, capacity exhaustion without eviction, startup recovery, logout
  protection and identity/key mismatch quarantine;
- persist-first scan behavior, single-flight FIFO, no later-event bypass and bounded retry jitter;
- legacy read-back-before-clear, injected migration/write failure and protected-v1 disposition;
- API extra-field/header/size/timeout/diagnostic rejection; and
- extended synthetic lease → offline capture → synchronization/reconciliation state.

No raw NFC payload, access token, SecureStore secret or SQLCipher key is persisted in server offline
tables, API diagnostics or React state.

## 4. Fresh local verification

Node 24, PostgreSQL 17 and Android release verification:

| Scope | Result |
|---|---:|
| Core | 290/290, 43 files |
| Mobile | 383/383, 27 files |
| Admin Web | 44/44, 5 files |
| Administration contract | 4/4 |
| Offline synchronization contract | 7/7 |
| Backend Schema | 125/125 |
| Backend Identity | 55/55 |
| Backend Read Model | 42/42 |
| Backend Lifecycle | 88/88 |
| Backend Bootstrap | 189/189 |
| Backend Administration | 121/121, 3 files |
| Backend Offline Synchronization | 12/12, 2 files |
| Backend API | 208/208, 6 files |
| Synthetic Android/Auth/API/PostgreSQL harness | 18/18, 2 files |
| B1 direct PostgreSQL harness | 39 passed, 2 unchanged optional Supavisor modes skipped |
| Total passed | 1,625 |

All 15 workspace TypeScript checks passed. Their package configurations include test sources where
tests exist. All workspace builds passed, including declarations/bundles, Admin Web Vite production
build, synthetic harness bundle and built C3B CLI verification. Android Expo export passed.

A fresh generated Android release build succeeded with 690 actionable Gradle tasks. It recognized
`taptime-monotonic-clock` 1.0.0, Expo SQLite/SQLCipher, background task, network and task-manager
modules and bundled the current 848-module JavaScript graph. The local-only APK is
`/private/tmp/taptime-android-final-20260718-2148/app-release.apk`, SHA-256
`e23903cebc4d82a2e4f149f70738e7b7070318edfe34bff08f2d9065a41458c2`. The pre-existing untracked
Android tree was restored after the build and is not part of this delta.

`npm ls --all --omit=optional`, migration apply/rerun/ledger verification, CI YAML parsing and
`git diff --check` passed.

## 5. Dependency-audit disposition

`npm audit --omit=dev` reports one moderate advisory family as 11 transitive occurrences:
`uuid@7.0.3` under `expo -> @expo/config-plugins -> xcode@3.0.1`. The advisory concerns caller-
provided buffers in UUID v3/v5/v6. The pinned Xcode project generator calls only `uuid.v4()` with no
buffer and is build/prebuild tooling, not the Android/product runtime or offline data path.

The registry offers no compatible `xcode` update; `xcode@3.0.1` still requires `uuid ^7.0.3`.
`npm audit fix --force` proposes the breaking and incorrect downgrade to Expo 46. A trial forced
major override was deliberately not retained because it is outside the upstream dependency
contract. This is a documented non-exploitable toolchain disposition, not a zero-advisory claim.
It must be rechecked when Expo/config-plugins publishes a compatible dependency update.

## 6. Technical-Lead disposition and remaining gates

The published Workstreams A–E implementation matches the accepted architecture and authorization.
The Technical Lead finds no open implementation P0/P1/P2/P3. Focused commit
`4f51918993e02b7bf51a1194f8d4d750abfae7c4`, tree
`617081f34e34cbf5e314a26f4cc634c846c2e319`, was fast-forward pushed from the exact authorized
baseline. GitHub Actions run `29675842388`, attempt 1, bound the exact implementation head and
passed all ten jobs.

Still pending and not claimed here:

1. independent read-only implementation review with zero open P0–P3;
2. separate Human authorization for the complete fresh Human Physical Gate;
3. the Human observations themselves and later closure synchronization;
4. any production resource/data, deployment or distribution decision.

DT-060–DT-062 remain open until every applicable later gate is complete.
