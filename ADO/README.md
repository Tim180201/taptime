# TapTim.e ADO

Status: Draft Navigation Entry Point  
Epic: EP-006  
Owner: Technical Lead  
Approval Authority: Human Architect

## Purpose

This file is the official navigation entry point for the TapTim.e ADO.

Every Human and AI Agent shall locate this document through repository evidence before executing ABS-001 and shall read it before AOS-001 begins.

FDOS Rule:

> Every engineering document required for agent initialization shall be reachable through one official ADO entry point.

FDOS Rule:

> Agents shall perform Repository Discovery and locate the official ADO navigation entry point before executing the bootstrap sequence.

## Startup Sequence Authority

`ADO/README.md` is the normative source for the official TapTim.e agent startup sequence.

Other EP-006 artifacts may include operational overviews, lifecycle models or prompt requirements. Those supporting diagrams shall not redefine the official startup sequence.

If an apparent conflict exists between this file and an overview or lifecycle diagram, this file is authoritative.

## Official Startup Sequence (Normative)

```text
GitHub Connector Verification
  -> Repository Discovery
  -> Locate the official ADO Navigation Entry Point
  -> Read ADO/README.md
  -> ABS-001 Agent Bootstrap Standard
  -> AOS-001 Agent Onboarding Standard
  -> ADS-001 Agent Discovery Standard
  -> RHS-001 Repository Health Standard
  -> AIR-001 Agent Inventory Report
  -> READY FOR WORK
  -> EOM-001 Engineering Operating Model
  -> AGR-001 Agent Registry
  -> Role Execution
```

## Discovery Compatibility Rule

The initial Repository Discovery before ABS-001 is limited to locating the official ADO navigation entry point and verifying that repository evidence supports the startup sequence.

ADS-001 remains the full Repository Discovery standard after AOS-001.

This preserves backward compatibility while removing the assumption that `ADO/README.md` is known before repository evidence has been inspected.
